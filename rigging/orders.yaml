# Command/action pairings for akizuki.
# Right now let's just stick with text reactions.

# Format for orders
# [order name]:
#     cl: [trigger words or phrases that will be preceded by the command prefix to call `akizuki`, separated by commas and enclosed by brackets]
#     do: [what akizuki will do when this command is called. in orders.yaml, this should only be text strings.]
#     tr: [format for terms to follow the command in helptext. this should generally be left blank.]
#     of: [helptext explaining what the command does.]

# If you want to add more, make sure to follow the format of [key: text]. 
# Do not follow a key with `, eg "of: `akizuki`" as that doesn't work for some reason.
# Remember to precede ' and " with \ as these strings will have to pass through python/yaml syntax before reaching users.
