# Map info for akizuki

# [map name in format #-#]:
#     map: [imgur/wikia link to map]
#     rte: |
#          [info/routing information]
#     drp: |
#          [list of notable/rare drops, separated by commas, and line breaks per node. if no notable drops, say "None notable."]
#     asv: [one line description of air superiority values necessary to reach notable nodes.]

# NOTE!!! Due to the way the import is written, removing a map from maps.yaml and calling +update will NOT completely remove it from the commands list without a restart of `akizuki`. Be VERY CAREFUL when adding new maps (or at least map codes) to te list!
# TODO: fix this
